## What's News

Version 1.0

This is the initial release of the PowerScout with features that are fully tested.



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The growing complexity of modern electronic systems often
leads to the design of more sophisticated power delivery networks
(PDNs). Similar to other system-level shared resources, the on-board PDN
unintentionally introduces side channels across design layers and voltage
domains, despite the fact that PDNs are not part of the functional design.

Thus, we develop PowerScout, a security-oriented PDN simulation framework that unifies
the modeling of different PDN-based side-channel attacks. PowerScout
performs fast nodal analysis of complex PDNs at the system level to
quantitatively evaluate the severity of side-channel vulnerabilities.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
+ PowerScout is based on **Ngspice** circuit simulator. To install:
   + For Windows: 
   Unzip `ngspice-34_dll_64.zip` to `C:\Program Files`. Make sure the path of `ngspice.dll` file is:
   
   ```shell
   C:\Program Files\Spice64_dll\dll-vs\ngspice.dll
   ```
   + For Linux: please refer [Ngspice manual](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf) for the detailed instructions.

### Installation
+ Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xz-group/PowerScout.git
```
